<p>Hi! I'm Darlene! Let me tell you a bit about myself. 
I know how much you love your pets... and that you consider them family members! That's why I believe it's important that you know a little more about me before you go ahead and decide to try my service. 
I myself have rescued four cats (with very unique personalities!) as well as a very cute, yet very demanding, yorkshire terrier. Recently, I've also added two new members to my family... a male and female chinchilla! Even as a young girl, I have raised and cared for birds, rabbits, squirrels, rodents, goats, and of course, dogs and cats, of all breeds. Whether big or small, furry or scaly, all animals need love! 
In my 10+ exciting years of in-home pet sitting and dog walking adventures, I have devoted much of my college career to studying and obtaining my degree in human behavior, and more recently, animal behavior! I have worked with children and animals with special needs for several years. Friends say patience is one of my stronger attributes, but having patience is easy for me because this is what I absolutely love to do! 
Qualifications (reword): In addiion to my 10+ years of pet-care experience, I've attained invaluable experience and knowledge working as a veterinary technician, becoming certified in pet first aid and CPR, and affiliated with several local veterinary hospitals and animal shelters. I am also a member of Petsitters International, and fully insured! 
Stay connected! Be sure to check out my Facebook page, where I post pictures of all of my visits! With every pet visit, pet parents can rest assured and know their pets are in good hands when I send text message and picture updates.</p>
