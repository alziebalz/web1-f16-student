		<h4>The Closest I've Gotten to Web Design/About me</h4>
		
		<p>
			I am technically in this class because I need the elective 			credits, however, programming and coding is something I have 			been heavily interested in since my junior year of highschool. 			Around this time, the iPod Touch was still relevant, and 			jailbreaking these and iPhones was the thing to do. My 			little brother finally convinced me to jailbreak, and as we 			excitedly scrolled through Cydia for themes to download, we 			found a lot of them were of shitty quality, though 			functional. I figured, if people could be bothered to figure 			out how to get their bottom-tier image all the way to their 			device, I could figure out how to do this with a TOP-tier 			image! <br />
			Soon, the requests came flooding in, from photographers, 			mechanics, Snap-On Tools, and others, for me to make them a 			slider or a battery or a time bar using their logo or 			image. Eventually, 800,000+ people would end up downloading 			the themes that I created! <br />
			In order for me to do this, I had to download another "app" 			called "iFile" once jailbroken so that I could see the 			files on the inside of the device, in order to insert my own 			versions. This is what began to get me interested in 			programming and coding, as I learned how to become somewhat 			fluent in reading OS code and navigating my way around! <br />
			What's so rewarding about it is there are so many people 			willing to teach and share this skill, that you can find all 			kinds of helpful tutorials and resources on the internet! I 			would even go so far as to say most programmers my age were 			self-taught to begin with, as an interest!
