	<h4>The Closest I've Gotten to Web Design/About me</h4>
	<p>
			I am technically in this class because I need the elective 		credits, however, programming and coding is something I have 		been heavily interested in since my junior year of highschool. 		Around this time, the iPod Touch was still relevant, and 		jailbreaking these and iPhones was the thing to do. My 		little brother finally convinced me to jailbreak, and as we 		excitedly scrolled through Cydia for themes to download, we 		found a lot of them were of shitty quality, though 		functional. I figured, if people could be bothered to figure 		out how to get their bottom-tier image all the way to their 		device, I could figure out how to do this with a TOP-tier 		image! <br /><br />
			Soon, the requests came flooding in, from photographers, 		mechanics, Snap-On Tools, and others, for me to make them a 		slider or a battery or a time bar using their logo or image. 		Eventually, 800,000+ people would end up downloading the themes 		that I created! <br /><br />
			In order for me to do this, I had to download another "app" 		called "iFile" once jailbroken so that I could see the 		files on the inside of the device, in order to insert my own 		versions. This is what began to get me interested in 		programming and coding, as I learned how to become somewhat fluent 		in reading OS code and navigating my way around! <br /><br />
		What's so rewarding about it is there are so many people 		willing to teach and share this skill, that you can find all 		kinds of helpful tutorials and resources on the internet! I 		would even go so far as to say most programmers my age were 		self-taught to begin with, as an interest! </p>
