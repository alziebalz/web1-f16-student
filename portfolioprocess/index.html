	<h1>Portfolio Process Page</h1>
	<p>A personal portfolio is important because it stores all of your work in one place for easy access, which is important for potential employers, interviews, and even for social networking with other artists. 
	As a graphic designer, I would like to convey organized creativity, showing my work in a simple way to let the work speak for itself. I will show all of my work, with the oldest work last, because it shows the growth over time of my knowledge and skills as a designer. I want to tell the story of adaptation and education, as prior to MassArt I hardly have any art background under my belt.</p>
	
	<h3>Inspiration</h3>
	
	<ul>
		<li><p><a href="http://www.perkybros.com/">Perky Bros</a></p>
			I like how simple and clean the layout is. Very basic but very functionable.</p></li>
		<li><p><a href="http://builtbybuffalo.com/">Built by Buffalo</a></p>
			I love how considered all of the text is even though there isn't a lot, such as "FEED", and when you click it, it creates a metaphor between a news feed and food feed.</p></li>
		<li><p><a href="http://apparatusstudio.com/">Apparatus</a></p>
			<p>I really love the image in the back to create dimension.</p></li> 
		<li><p><a href="http://www.greysaga.com/index.html">Grey Saga</a></p>
			<p>I love the overall feel and look of this site, it has a lot of nice things working, but navigation is really difficult.</p></li>

	<h3>Architecture Diagram</h3>

	I really enjoy the minimalistic approach, so I will have my landing page that will have my name, a short introduction, and then a grid of my work, and just two other links to "about" and "contact", which will link my resume.
	
	<h3>Ideation</h3>
	<img src="Images/process1.JPG" width="300 px">
	<p>I like the idea of an image being static behind the text that flows over it and would like to somehow implement that into the title of my page, where I would have my name.</p>
	<img src="Images/process2.JPG" width="300 px">
	<p>I also like the idea of having clean linework instead of images, so nothing conflicts with the actual body of work that I'm trying to show.</p>
	<img src="Images/process3.JPG" width="300px">
	<p>In my "contact" page, I would ideally like to include a form so that people who wish to contact me can do so directly.</p>
