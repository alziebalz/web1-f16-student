			<p>Darlene is a professional dog walker in her early thirties, 			based out of the Taunton/Raynham area. Having rescued and cared for 			countless animals throughout her life, her love of animals began from 			when she was a young girl, having raised birds, rabbits, squirrels, 			rodents, goats, dogs, and cats.</p>
			<p>Darlene spent most of her college career studying and obtaining 			a degree in human behavior, but she is currently researching animal 			behavior.  She has worked with children and animals with special 			needs for several years, and has also become affiliated with several 			local veterinarian hospitals and shelters. Working as a veterinary 			technician left her with invaluable knowledge and experience, and she 			is certified in Pet First Aid and CPR and holds certification from 			PetSitters International.
			<p>With over 10 exciting years of in home pet sitting and dog 			walking under her belt, Darlene has built up a wonderful and large 			network of trusted pet parents, and even took on a select few 			assistants to help her accomodate as many clients as possible. 			However, there is only one Darlene, and so she has fine-tuned a 			system that works for her, and leads us into why she needs her 			website: so pet parents know exactly how it works!
		<li><h4 id="clientneeds">Client Needs</h2></li>
			<p>Darlene needs a website that outlines exactly how her system 			works for new pet parents, and exhibits some key services she now 			offers that her existing clients may not know about, such as Wedding 			Services.</p>
			<p>She wants it to include her expectations of her relationship 			with her clients, as well as what they can expect from her. What is 			also really important to her is that her clients give her plenty of 			notice to try and accomodate their needs, as lately she seems to be 			getting a lot of last-minute, day-of text messages and voicemails 			asking her to drop by, which she no longer has the time or luxury of 			doing.
			
		<li><h4 id="relatedweb">Related Websites</h4></li>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://www.wannagooutboston.com/">WannaGoOut?</a></li>
			<p>Immediate reaction is this website is super friendly, you have 			the fluid, moving icon in the top left, which is active and fun, there 			are bright colors and friendly typography. The sizes, colors, and 			blockiness is a bit clunky and doesn't feel polished but all of the 			important information is right there on the front page.</p>
			<li><a href="http://www.backbaydogwalking.com/">Back Bay 			Dogwalking</a></li>
			<p>This website is a bit confusing, even though hierarchially it 			makes sense, there are way too many navigational buttons (they can 			definitely be consolidated into broader categories), and the buttons 			that ARE there are glitchy and cut off by the photo. When you click 			through them they seem just barely unified because they each behave 			a little differently. The gallery is nice though. This site is 			actually really close to what Darlene has had in the past.</p>
			<li><a href="http://furryfriendpetcare.net/">Furry Friend 			Petcare</a></li>
			<p>This website is a total bombardment to the senses. Too many 			buttons and far to much information. It needs to be broken up more, 			and there needs to be a stronger sense of hierarchy.</p>
			<li><a href="http://www.waggingtaildogservice.com/">Wagging Tail 			Dog Service</a></li>
			<p>I really enjoy the horizontal feel to this website and the way 			that it is laid out! It has all of the important information without 			being clunky or cluttered!

	<p>Darlene loves pinks and purples and is constantly wearing accessories 		or clothing to match, and to me it's just a part of who she is. Her 		business cards are also made up of pinks and purples, which is why I 		would like to stay within this family.</p>

	<p>Darlene's Busypaws. Dog Walking and Pet Sitting. "I'm there when you can't be!"<br />(Logo?)<br />508 728 8344 Call us today to schedule an interview!<br />Social media links, photos</p>
	<h5>About Page</h5>
	<p>Hi! I'm Darlene! Let me tell you a bit about myself. <br /> I know how much you love your pets... and that you consider them family members! That's why I believe it's important that you know a little more about me before you go ahead and decide to try my service. <br />I myself have rescued four cats (with very unique personalities!) as well as a very cute, yet very demanding, yorkshire terrier. Recently, I've also added two new members to my family... a male and female chinchilla! Even as a young girl, I have raised and cared for birds, rabbits, squirrels, rodents, goats, and of course, dogs and cats, of all breeds. Whether big or small, furry or scaly, all animals need love! <br /> In my 10+ exciting years of in-home pet sitting and dog walking adventures, I have devoted much of my college career to studying and obtaining my degree in human behavior, and more recently, animal behavior! I have worked with children and animals with special needs for several years. Friends say patience is one of my stronger attributes, but having patience is easy for me because this is what I absolutely love to do! <br /> Qualifications (reword): In addiion to my 10+ years of pet-care experience, I've attained invaluable experience and knowledge working as a veterinary technician, becoming certified in pet first aid and CPR, and affiliated with several local veterinary hospitals and animal shelters. I am also a member of Petsitters International, and fully insured! <br />Stay connected! Be sure to check out my Facebook page, where I post pictures of all of my visits! With every pet visit, pet parents can rest assured and know their pets are in good hands when I send text message and picture updates.</p>
	<h5>Services</h5>
	<p>Daily visits<br />In 30-minute visits, Darlene replenishes food and water, may administer medication (additional rates may apply), and play with your pet, either with toys or along a local walk, ensuring your furry friend gets some exercise! <br /><br />Overnights<br />(text)<br />Visiting Hours<br />Our typical day begins at 6am and ranges to about 10:30pm. (Depending on your pet's needs, Darlene's Busypaws may visit earlier or later.)<br />Each fun-filled visit is 20-45 minutes, depending on the service.<br />Darlene's Busypaws also offers weekends and overnights, for those friends who get anxious being alone at night. *Please note that this is around-the-clock care*</p>
	<h5>Contact</h5>
	<p>Interviews<br />The interview process is the best way to introduce ourselves to you and your pet! It is also the time to complete your pet's information chart, discuss daily routines and needs, favorite toys, etc., and to complete any necessary paperwork. (Hours/link to schedule)<br /><br />Regretful Cancelations<br />We kindly ask you to notify us 48 hours before the scheduled visit. <br />We realize you'd love to cut out of work early to be with your pal... Sadly, a vacation had to be postponed... or even for any other reason, we understand! However, notice within 48 hours or none at all may result in a cancelation fee.</p>
