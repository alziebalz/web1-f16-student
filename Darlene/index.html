	<h2>Client Notes and Information</h1>
	<ol>
		<li><h4>Meeting Notes</h4>
			<p>Darlene is a professional dog walker in her early thirties, 			based out of the Taunton/Raynham area. Having rescued and cared for 			countless animals throughout her life, her love of animals began from 			when she was a young girl, having raised birds, rabbits, squirrels, 			rodents, goats, dogs, and cats.</p>
			<p>Darlene spent most of her college career studying and obtaining 			a degree in human behavior, but she is currently researching animal 			behavior.  She has worked with children and animals with special 			needs for several years, and has also become affiliated with several 			local veterinarian hospitals and shelters. Working as a veterinary 			technician left her with invaluable knowledge and experience, and she 			is certified in Pet First Aid and CPR and holds certification from 			PetSitters International.
			<p>With over 10 exciting years of in home pet sitting and dog 			walking under her belt, Darlene has built up a wonderful and large 			network of trusted pet parents, and even took on a select few 			assistants to help her accomodate as many clients as possible. 			However, there is only one Darlene, and so she has fine-tuned a 			system that works for her, and leads us into why she needs her 			website: so pet parents know exactly how it works!
		<li><h4>Client Needs</h2></li>
			<p>Darlene needs a website that outlines exactly how her system 			works for new pet parents, and exhibits some key services she now 			offers that her existing clients may not know about, such as Wedding 			Services.</p>
			<p>She wants it to include her expectations of her relationship 			with her clients, as well as what they can expect from her. What is 			also really important to her is that her clients give her plenty of 			notice to try and accomodate their needs, as lately she seems to be 			getting a lot of last-minute, day-of text messages and voicemails 			asking her to drop by, which she no longer has the time or luxury of 			doing.

			<li><a href="http://www.wannagooutboston.com/">WannaGoOut?</a></li>
			<p>Immediate reaction is this website is super friendly, you have 			the fluid, moving icon in the top left, which is active and fun, there 			are bright colors and friendly typography. The sizes, colors, and 			blockiness is a bit clunky and doesn't feel polished but all of the 			important information is right there on the front page.</p>
			<li><a href="http://www.backbaydogwalking.com/">Back Bay 			Dogwalking</a></li>
			<p>This website is a bit confusing, even though hierarchially it 			makes sense, there are way too many navigational buttons (they can 			definitely be consolidated into broader categories), and the buttons 			that ARE there are glitchy and cut off by the photo. When you click 			through them they seem just barely unified because they each behave 			a little differently. The gallery is nice though. This site is 			actually really close to what Darlene has had in the past.</p>
			<li><a href="http://furryfriendpetcare.net/">Furry Friend 			Petcare</a></li>
			<p>This website is a total bombardment to the senses. Too many 			buttons and far to much information. It needs to be broken up more, 			and there needs to be a stronger sense of hierarchy.</p>
			<li><a href="http://www.waggingtaildogservice.com/">Wagging Tail 			Dog Service</a></li>
			<p>I really enjoy the horizontal feel to this website and the way 			that it is laid out! It has all of the important information without 			being clunky or cluttered!
